1. Test automation: Utilising automation testing tools and frameworks can ensure software meets functional, performance, and security requirements.
2. Continuous integration and delivery: A CI/CD pipeline helps to ensure new code changes are tested and deployed to production quickly and efficiently, reducing the time it takes to deliver new features to users.
3. Test-driven development: Encouraging test-driven development can help ensure code meets requirements and reduces the number of defects that are introduced.
4. Code reviews: A rigorous code review process helps to identify defects early in the development process, reducing the time and cost of fixing defects later.
5. Manual testing: While automation testing is important, manual testing is still necessary for scenarios where automation testing may not be suitable, such as exploratory testing or usability testing.

A holistic approach that combines both manual and automation testing is often the most effective strategy for ensuring software quality.
